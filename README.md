## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Face Detection** 🧑‍💻
- **Liveness Detection** using facial landmarks 👁️👁️
- **Simple and Intuitive UI** 🎨
- **Secure and Fast** 🛡️⚡

## 🎯 How It Works

- The application captures real-time video from the webcam.
- It uses OpenCV and Haar cascades to detect faces and eyes in the video feed.
- A simple liveness check is performed by ensuring that both eyes are detected in the frame.
- If liveness is detected, a green bounding box with "Liveness Detected" is shown. Otherwise, it indicates "Spoof Detected" with a red bounding box.
